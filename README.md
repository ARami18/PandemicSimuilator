# PandemicSimulator

Project done in collaboration with Huigon Shin, Juyeong Kim, Hongseok Kim.

Project is a GUI application that allows a user to input certain parameters about a population in terms of how many people are vaccinated or unvaccinated, then run a simulation to see how quickly a disease will spread through a population of a given size. The app will simulate a period of three weeks in which there will be one infected person in the population at the start of the simulation. The infected person will then interact with the rest of the population, and the spread of the disease will be seen based on assumptions about the level of protection against the disease in the rest of the population.

NOTE: although the mathematics behind pandemic simulation can be complex, we used fairly simple assumptions related to probability as it pertains to an individual contracting the disease from an infected individual.
